The Secure Entry System using Flask and WebRTC is a web-based visitor authentication
platform designed to enhance access control in residential and commercial settings. Visitors
request access through a web interface, where their webcam snapshot is captured using WebRTC
technology and securely transmitted to the owner’s dashboard. The owner can review the request
in real time and provide a unique, time-bound access code. This code is then verified on the
visitor’s interface via a Flask backend, ensuring secure and controlled entry. The system maintains
an access history log with timestamps and verification results for auditing purposes. By combining
lightweight server-side processing with modern browser-based media capture, the project delivers
a cost-effective, scalable, and user-friendly solution for secure entry management. Keywords: Secure Entry System, Flask framework, WebRTC, Web-based access control, Visitor
